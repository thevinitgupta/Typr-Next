# Typr Next ⌨️

Typr is the next generation typing practice website. 
How? Well, it's simple and works on real world text.

## Tech Stack
- `NextJS` for building the actual Application
- `Appwrite` for authentication and data
- `TailwindCSS` for the look and feel
- `Rechart` for visualizing your progress

## Why Typr?
It is the upgrade of my first ever project - [Typr](https://thevinitgupta.github.io/Typr/). 

But why did I build Typr? 

I was bored to the usaual practice websites that made you practice typing with some random characters.

> _The real speed comes from the ability to type fast when it comes to the real world and not some randomized characters_

This was the main idea behind Typr and eventually Typr Next, that `let's you see your progress over time`.
